- 👋 Hi, I’m @kniccknakk, an Information Science graduate, and my GitHub journey reflects my explorations in diverse areas. In INFO 2950, I delved into mathematical methods for information science, touching on data science applications. My INFO 1300 experience introduced me to web development basics, while ORIE 4350 broadened my understanding of game theory. CS 1110 equipped me with Python skills and foundational algorithms. Check out my projects for practical insights into my learning journey. I've also delved into Macro VBA, showcasing my curiosity. Join me as I navigate the intersections of coding, data science, and game theory. Let's explore together!
- 👀 I’m interested in Exploring new coding challenges, data science applications, and game theory concepts. I have a keen interest in the intersections of technology and its diverse applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about webscraping! Exploring the realm of web scraping and understanding its applications in improving the accessibility of information. Fascinated by the potential to extract valuable insights from diverse online sources.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to coding, data science, and game theory. Whether it's enhancing algorithms, developing web applications, or diving into strategic game simulations, I'm open to collaborative opportunities.
- 📫 How to reach me: Pleas feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or reach out via email at na323@cornell.edu or cb21106@qmul.ac.uk

- ⚡ Fun fact: my fun fact is that in my free time, I enjoy the piano and to learn new languages (non-computing)
* Projects include:
   * Numerous Python coding projects: recursion, looping, etc.
   * Data Science projects: correlations, data quality, summary statistics, linear and non linear models, *data scraping*, stats tests, train-test-splits, A/B testing, data cleaning, probabilities/distributions (conditional, log-odds , text as data, and more!
   * Game Theory: Simulated fictitious play in two games and a (quite) brief analysis
   * Macro VBA projects to organize outlook inboxes
   * numerous webdesign projects, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
  
- NOTES: if you are interested in viewing any of my projects, please let me know so I can share these with you -- branches are different projects, repos are different courses/broader topics for which these specific projects were created. These repos are private until further notice because despite being my creations, I don't want to violate any Cornell IP rules. Looking into this and hoping to publish as public archive so soon!
